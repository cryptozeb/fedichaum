# Federated Chaumian Banks

This paper describes the fundamental building blocks of federated chaumian banks and explores the benefits and
challenges arising from the distribution of trust. It can be seen as a theoretical foundation for  more concrete
projects like [SCRIT](https://github.com/scritcash/scrit-whitepaper).

For now it's more of a draft and I'd like to expand it based on community feedback through issues and PRs.

## Local builds

To build the PDF locally you need LaTeX (something like `texlive`), `biber` for the bibliography and `latexmk` to
take care of all the LaTeX build weirdness for you. Then you should be able to build the PDF by running `latexmk -pdf`.
